# File to Audio Converter - Python Requirements

# Core functionality (NO external dependencies required!)
# The tool uses only Python standard library for basic encoding/decoding:
# - wave (audio file handling)
# - struct (binary data packing)
# - os (file operations)

# OPTIONAL: For encryption support only
# Install with: pip install cryptography
# cryptography>=41.0.0

# Python 3.6+ required

# To install encryption support:
# pip install cryptography

# To use without encryption:
# No installation needed! Just run with Python 3.6+
